# Docker Compose of MariaDB

A very simple docker-compose of MariaDB.

This repo is only used on my Raspberry Pi 3 with Ubuntu 18.04 (ARM64).

The root user is configured in `mariadb.env` and allowed to login from anywhere.

A user named `user` and its password `password` is created by
`initdb.d/createUser.sql`, the database for this user is named `user_db`.
